# matrix_game

This is my first Python program. Well first program of any kind.
Just a quick code block with a Matrix theme to practice. 
Goals I wanted to achieve with it are to create a series of functions 
that run depending on an input response in the terminal. Also using
the time() module to create dramatic effect with printed text.
